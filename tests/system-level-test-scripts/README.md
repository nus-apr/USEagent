# System Level Tests

In this folder are `informal` tests that help to reproduce some of the issues we see from our experiments. 
They are not meant to be part of the CI/CD and run all the time, 
but more to have an easy way to reproduce reported behaviour. 

Each script gets a small header linking to issues and what was observed. 
They are similar in nature to the scripts in `./scripts`. 

With more programming efforts the issues might disappear and the scripts deprecate (i.e. their bug got fixed or changed)
